# New-York-City-Tax-Fare

The goal of this project is to build a prediction model for a startup that aims to enter a competitive taxi market. The company expects to offer lower taxi fares to attract customers from their rivals. In the meanwhile, they don't want to lose so much for the low-price competition, hence they desire the model's accuracy.
